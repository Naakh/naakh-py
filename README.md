# Naakh Python bindings

## Installation
You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just want to use the Naakh Python bindings, you should just run:

```
pip install --upgrade stripe
```
or 
```
easy_install --upgrade naakh
```

See http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html for instructions on installing pip. If you are on a system with easy_install but not pip, you can use easy_install instead. If you're not using virtualenv, you may have to prefix those commands with sudo. You can learn more about virtualenv at http://www.virtualenv.org/

To install from source, run: 

```
python setup.py install
```
